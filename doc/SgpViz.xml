<Colophon>
      This manual describes the &GAP; package &SgpViz;, Version <#Include SYSTEM "../version">, for visualising finite semigroups.<P/>
      <P/>
      Since Version 0.998 (released in 2008), the package is maintained by the first author.
      <P/>
      The present package is superseded by the &GAP; package <E>semigroups</E>, by James Mitchel, in what concerns some aspects of semigroup visualisation. We strongly recommend the usage of that package, unless you find useful specific tools available in &SgpViz; but not in <E>semigroups</E>. 
<P/>
Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome. Please use the
email address <Email>mdelgado@fc.up.pt</Email> to this effect.
<P/>

If you have benefited from the use of the &SgpViz; &GAP; package in your research, please cite it in addition to &GAP; itself, following the scheme proposed in
<URL>https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/cite.html</URL>.
