  [33X[0;0YThe  aim  of  this package is to turn [5X GAP [105X more user-friendly, at least for
  semigroup  theorists.  It  requires the usage of external programs as is the
  case of [10Xgraphviz[110X [DEG+02], a software for drawing graphs developed at AT & T
  Labs, that can be obtained at [7Xhttps://www.graphviz.org/[107X. It is used not only
  to draw right Cayley graphs of finite semigroups and Sch√ºzenberger graphs of
  finite inverse semigroups but also to visualise in the usual way the egg-box
  picture  of a D-classe of a finite semigroup. [12XImportant note[112X: The version of
  [10Xgraphviz[110X  to install must be greater or equal to 1.16. Tcl/Tk should also be
  available in order to run the graphical interfaces[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[12XWarning[112X:  the  use  of XAutomaton and XSemigroup is intended only for simple
  examples. After its use one may have to start another GAP session.[133X
