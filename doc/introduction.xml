The aim of this package is to turn 
<Package> GAP </Package> more user-friendly, at least for semigroup theorists.
It requires the usage of external programs as is the case of 
<C>graphviz</C> <Cite Key="KoutsofiosNorth:2002"/>, a software for drawing graphs developed at AT

It is used not only to draw right Cayley graphs of finite semigroups and Schüzenberger graphs of finite inverse semigroups but also to visualise in the usual way the egg-box picture of a D-classe of a finite semigroup.
