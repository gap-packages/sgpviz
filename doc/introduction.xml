The aim of this package is to turn 
<Package> GAP </Package> more user-friendly, at least for semigroup theorists.
It requires the usage of external programs as is the case of 
<C>graphviz</C> <Cite Key="KoutsofiosNorth:2002"/>, a software for drawing graphs developed at AT

It is used not only to draw right Cayley graphs of finite semigroups and Sch√ºzenberger graphs of finite inverse semigroups but also to visualise in the usual way the egg-box picture of a D-classe of a finite semigroup.
